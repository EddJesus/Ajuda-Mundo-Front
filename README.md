<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

Exist a lot of project that are made to serve great companies and a big amount of clients. Here we just want to create an POC to a system where NGOs can create some "issues" that will be solved by anyone who wants to

Here's why:
* This is a space where you, as a normal user, can help make the world a better place to live by contributing with NGOs
* This is also a space where you, as a NGO, can find help to solve minor questions you need to

This is designed to have an incentive to normal user wants to solve the tasks the NGOs puts there (besided making the world a better place). This incentive is points that are given to the user when they accomplish the taks. This points is defined by the NGO when they are creating the task.
